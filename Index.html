    <a href="PedirTrabajadores.html">Function 3</a>
    <p>NAME: Trabajadores : a working shift timetable.
    <p>SHORT DESCRIPTION:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    This function will allow the user to cheeck each employee's work shifts and also to add off days if required.

    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>EXPLANATION: When the user accesses the PedirTrabajadores.html form, it will be required to introduce a date. Once this is done, the servlet will get those values and print an interactive work shift table, by clicking 
       the submit button and will print a calendar with the employees' working shifts, by getting them from the database. There is a draggable button to set a day or days off, which by dropping it on a certain day it automatically updates the work shift.
       On the only HTML version, the table printed is static, not read from the DB. Instead, in the functions deliverable, this is done.

    <p>EXPLANATION:We need to insert the information abaut the advertising campaign we are looking forward to do. When we click in the button "Save" the information will be directly saved in the database, and the user will receive a message in the interface showing the information he has inserted. We also have a button that allows us to delete the campaign we have just inserted, if it is not the adequate one.
